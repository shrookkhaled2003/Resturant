# Restaurant Website

[Live Demo](https://shrookkhaled2003.github.io/Resturant/)

This project is a responsive restaurant landing page built using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript. It was developed to practice modern layout techniques and mobile navigation.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to build a fully responsive landing page with a clean layout, using Bootstrap for grid structure and CSS media queries to support various screen sizes. JavaScript is used for simple mobile menu toggling and dynamic content loading using Fetch API.

## Features

- Responsive design using CSS media queries  
- Bootstrap 5 for layout and spacing utilities  
- Custom navigation bar with toggle functionality for mobile  
- Smooth, clean layout with image sections and text content  
- Modern section structure (hero, about, menu, contact, etc.)  
- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no libraries or icons)  
- Dynamic content loading with Fetch API  

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
  - Media Queries  
  - Responsive Units
- **Bootstrap 5**
  - Grid System  
  - Utility Classes
- **JavaScript**
  - Event handling for responsive menu toggle  
  - **Fetch API** for loading and displaying menu items dynamically from a JSON file  

## Dynamic Data Loading

This project demonstrates the use of the **Fetch API** to retrieve data from a local JSON file and display it inside the page dynamically. This approach allows content (like menu items) to be updated or managed easily without modifying the HTML structure.
